    <!--
    table tag is the main tag & it has table row(tr) & table data(td) tags in it
    to represent row & data(in col)
    Aside from these, tables also have headers, body & footer just like our HTML sites
    & you can declare them quite simply using thead for table head, tbody for table body
    & tfoot for table footer.
    
    Inside thead we can add column headers, also instead of td we use th in them
    We can remove this thead tag & just keep the th & still it will produce similar result
    although thead tag here as it separated table header with table body, we can use some 
    code to isolate the header & fix it in place so that when user scroll through table
    (lets say there's slider & table has lots of data)
    we can keep its headings on screen even when user scrolls down (using Js & CSS). That's the 
    reason thead is used. Similar is the reason to use tbody (table body) & table footer (tfoot).
