    <!--metadata or associated data to your HTML page, in this case charset
    UTF-8 implies our webpage is encoded using UTF-8 encoding system. UTF-8 is 
    a standard encoding since it includes all international symbols(related to languages)
    & every single symbol from Unicode character set. So this gives your website maximum chance
    to be rendered correctly on browsers that are from international visitors
    Apart from charset there are other attributes to meta tag also exist like name ,
    content etc. Content when used with name="description" attr gives info to search engines 
    about content of website. So this is what search engines do, they crawl the 
    HTML of your site & look for certain meta tags in order to know what your website is about
    & also how to display it in their search index-->

    <h1>Shardul</h1>
    <p> Text in paragraph - <em>emphasized</em>, <i>italics</i>  </p>
    <!--Both <i> & <em> tags do the same thing visually ie italisize the text.
    By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is 
    different. The <em> element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while 
    the <i> element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such a 
    foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the 
    definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning. 
    (The title of a work, such as the name of a book or movie, should use <cite>.)
    This means the right one to use depends on the situation. Neither is for purely 
    decorative purposes, that's what CSS styling is for.
    An example for <em> could be: "Just do it already!", or: "We had to do something about it". A person or software reading the 
    text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

    An example for <i> could be: "The Queen Mary sailed last night". 
    Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". 
    It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary, 
    but a ship named Queen Mary. 
    Another example for <i> could be: "The word the is an article

    Similar pair is <b> & <strong> tag. 
    <b> is for presentation, and <strong> is for context. 
    Visual browsers usually render strong text as bold, 
    but things such as screen readers can render it as a louder voice. 
    The <strong> tag is a phrase tag. The <b> tag is a font-style tags.

    <!--src attr contains src while alt attr contains text to disp when img cant be found at the
    given src location. This is also helpful for SEO, the text in alt attr lets say if it's burrito helps search engines to
    to index & figure out that may be your webpage is listed when somebody is searching for burritos
    
    For src attr you can also use file paths. It's much more reliable since the online path where the img is located may go down
    in the future causing your site to not render the img-->
